    <h1>CSS Takeaways</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The browser is responsive. Use it to avoid Media Queries</li>
        <li>As soon as you start setting values you might create issues</li>
        <li>The body is the viewport. If you create a parent div it has 100% of the viewport</li>
        <li>Try to use percentages for a width, not fixed pixels</li>
        <li>The child container always get its percentages from the parent</li>
        <li>In general try to avoid using height</li>
        <li>Use em and rem that are relative measures. Usually 1 em is 16px. In CSS, "em" is a relative unit that scales based on the font size of the parent element, while "rem" scales based on the font size of the root element (usually the HTML tag), meaning "em" is relative to the immediate parent, while "rem" is relative to the entire document's root font size, providing more consistent scaling across the page. </li>

    </ul>
