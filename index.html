    <h1>CSS Takeaways</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The browser is responsive. Use it to avoid Media Queries</li>
        <li>As soon as you start setting values you might create issues</li>
        <li>The body is the viewport. If you create a parent div it has 100% of the viewport</li>
        <li>Try to use percentages for a width, not fixed pixels</li>
        <li>The child container always get its percentages from the parent</li>
        <li>In general try to avoid using height</li>
        <li>Use em and rem, they are relative measures. Usually 1 em is 16px. In CSS, "em" is a relative unit that scales based on the font size of the parent element, while "rem" scales based on the font size of the root element (usually the HTML tag), meaning "em" is relative to the immediate parent, while "rem" is relative to the entire document's root font size, providing more consistent scaling across the page. </li>
        <li>rem are refering to the root font-size while em are refering to the parent. em can work in exponentially way. em might be useful for padding buttons with different sizes</li>
        <li>em and rem make your life easier when you have to work with media queries or working with scalable elements</li>
        <li>Avoid using em for nested items in general and font sizes</li>
        <li>For font sizes better to use rem</li>
        <li>Might be a good idea using em for padding in a button or for margin between pieces of text</li>
        <li>The difference between vw (or vh) and percentages is that vw and vh are relative to the viewport whereas percentages are relative to the parent element.</li>
        <li>In small size devices you might run into issues with vw and vh</li>
        <li>vw can be a good option for titles but anyway you will need some media queries for very small or very large screens</li>
        <li>For modifying HTML you can use CTRL + SHIFT + P emmet: wrap with abbreviation</li>
        <li>Use percentages for widths, avoiding to set heights, use max-width</li>
